I started my blog exactly a year ago, wrote four posts over three months, and then disappeared. I wanted to post new articles at least every month, but I failed. I failed because I didn't have a daily dedicated time for my blog. 

A lot of things changed since that time (and I will write a post about it), now I'm back. I've been working on **megus.org** for the past two weeks every single day and here are some updates:

- The new [Portfolio]({% link portfolio.html %}) section
- The updated [Resume](/files/Roman_Petrov_CV.pdf) page
- A new article is close to completion, I plan to publish it next week. 

Megus is back, stay tuned for updates!
