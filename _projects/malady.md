I wrote Malady in 1999, and it took the 3rd place at CAFe'99 demoparty in ZX 4K Intro Compo. I thought that the source code was lost, but I found it at [ZX Spectrum Open Source Web Project](http://opensourcezx.untergrund.net/b_demo-malady_src.html) and uploaded it to [GitHub](https://github.com/Megus/malady4k).

The list of effects:

- Water effect
- Raycasting
- Motion-blurred roto-zoomer
- 2D Turing machine
- Fire effect
