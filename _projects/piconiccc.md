PICONICCC is a PICO-8 remix of a classic Atari ST demo [ST NICCC 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqVJWFNpTqA).

Creating ST NICCC clones on all possible platforms is a demoscene challenge, similar to Doom or Bad Apple challenges. The original demo uses a 640KB data file. A single PICO-8 cartridge can fit only about 12KB of arbitrary data. To fit the whole 3D scene in a single cartridge, we re-created it with 3D models. In my opinion, finding clever solutions to overcome platform limitations and do what seemed to be impossible to do is the essence of the demoscene on old-school platforms.

PICONICCC was released at [DiHalt 2021 demoparty](https://events.retroscene.org/dh2021) and took the 2nd place in the demo compo.
