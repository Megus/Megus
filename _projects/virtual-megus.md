Procedural music is one of my long-time interests. Virtual Megus is the attempt to create a system
which plays neverending electronic music. I’m not into abstract noises, so my goal is to
achieve pleasant-sounding results. As a musician, I obviously have some biases, and my system
will probably have them too, hence the name — Virtual Megus.
