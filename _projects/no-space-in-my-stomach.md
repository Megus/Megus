> Stewart is not a lucky guy. Not only he was born as a snail far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy, but once upon a time, he woke up in a mysterious dungeon from which, it would seem, there is no way out. However, he found out that he can clear the way by eating colored pills lying here and there. It's a pity that there is so little space in the stomach...

We ([Wise Hedgehog Studio](https://wisehedgehog.studio)) developed this game during Ludum Dare 42 game jam. When you have only 72 hours to create a game from scratch, it boosts your creativity.

I wrote all the code, and composed music, my wife Anna created all the graphics, and Stanislav Rozhkov did all the game design work: game mechanics and level design. The game is developed with [Defold game engine](https://www.defold.com).
