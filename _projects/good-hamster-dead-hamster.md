We ([Wise Hedgehog Studio](https://wisehedgehog.studio)) developed this game during Ludum Dare 41 game jam. It is an attempt to create a fun game based purely on cellular automaton. I think it is good as a jam entry, but I couldn't devise ideas to make it a real game unfortunately.

I wrote the game logic and composed music, my wife Anna created all the graphics, Sandra wrote the UI code. The game is developed with [Defold game engine](https://www.defold.com).
